                  constructed a symbol table. Then used this symbol table to
                  complete lexical and syntactic analysis, code optimization,

              </h3>
              <p>
                In Python, I developed a wide range of bioinformatics tools to
                analyze genetic sequences in order to better understand the
                technology I was employing in my own research. I built basic
                programs for sequence alignment using Needleman-Wunsch &
                Smith-Waterman algorithms. Sequence alignment is often one of
                the first steps in analyzing genetic data, as the output will
                let you compare analagous regions from different sequences.
                Next, I developed simple phylogenetic tree building software
                using distance, maximum likelihood, and parsimony to reason
                about how closely related a group of sequences are. The last
                part of this software suite was a genome annotation algorithm
                that used hidden markov models to predict gene boundaries.

                I worked with a team of 5 students to create a better way to
                train doctors on performing intubation on neonates (newborns).
                We created a virtual reality simulation of a neonatal intubation
                procedure that incorporated haptic feedback. We used CT data to
                reconstruct the internal anatomy of a neonate's airway (the
                internal anatomy can be seen in the video below) and combined
                that with a hollow shell of a neonate. This model was then
                placed into a Unity scene. A haptic feedback device was used to
                manipulate a model of a laryngoscope in the simulation and
                provide physical feedback to the user's hand when a collision
                occured in the virtual space. We also built a model of a giraffe
                intubation carestation (where this procedure would take place)
                and provided some sound bytes that make the environment more
                realistic.

              I studied the molecular evolution of bicarbonate ion transporters

              drosophila melanogaster. This is known as gene mining. This was

              &nbsp; in order to learn more about the relationships between
              these genes and eventually create phylogenetic trees. Below is an
              example of a phylogenetic tree which gives some information into
              the evolutionary history of these genes. Eventually, the goal of
              the project was to use tools like those available through&nbsp;
              <a href="http://tcoffee.crg.cat/" style={{ color: "white" }}>
                datamonkey
              </a>
              &nbsp; to learn about which parts of these genes are undergoing
              natural selection and build and understanding of how they might
              continue to evolve in the future. Unfortunately, so little is
              known about the structure and function of these genes that the
              project had to be put on hold until some more research became
              available.

              I worked with another undergraduate researcher to test the effects
              of sterols and dinoflagettes as dietary suppliments for the
              copepod eurytemora affinis. These copepods are used all around the
              world as food for fisheries and the ability to culture them as
              efficiently as possible is of paramount importance to
              aquaculturists. The graphs below show a little bit of our results.
              Fucosterol significantly increased hatching rate and the
              dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum increased the egg number of
              the copepods. None of the other results were significant. I'm
              currently working with my research partner to finish the paper on
              this project and get the work published.
